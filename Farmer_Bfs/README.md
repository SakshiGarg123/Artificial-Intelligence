Farmer, Goat, Wolf and Cabbage Problem
There is a farmer who wishes to cross a river but he is not alone. He also has a goat, a wolf and a cabbage along with him. There is only one boat available and only farmer can handle the boat. Boat can support the farmer and either of the goat, wolf or the cabbage. So at a time, the boat can have only two objects (farmer and one other). But the problem is, if the goat and wolf are left alone, the wolf will eat the goat. Similarly, if the Goat and cabbage are left alone, then goat will eat the cabbage. The farmer wants to cross the river with all three of his belongings: goat, wolf and cabbage.
